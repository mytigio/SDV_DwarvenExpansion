[center][size=6]Dwarven﻿﻿[/size][size=6] Expansion[/size][/center]
A recreation of my Dwarvish mod for Stardew Valley using the expanded modding features available in 1.6

[size=5]Version 2.0 Major Changes[/size]
Version 2.0 comes with an overhaul of how alchemy / potion brewing works.  Details can be found throughout the document but the high level changes are as follows:
[list=1]
[*]Dwarven Spirits are now made in the Keg like other drinks.  Put Cave Carrot Mash into the Keg to create Dwarven Spirits.
[*]The Dwarven Still is now a Dwarven Infuser.  It can infused basic Dwarven Spirits to create an artisan good ("flavored" dwarven spirits which sell for substantially more).
[*]The alchemy bench now creates reagents instead of potions. Specific recipes can be found in the detailed info artical, this page will include the base ingredients to use.
[*]Potions are now made as cooking recipes, each potion will require a Dwarven Spirit, a mineral dust, a powdered reagent (these have bag sprites) and a liquid reagent (these have vial sprites).
[*]Shadowed Elixir, Swordsmans Elixir and Ogre Kings Draft apply a buff, meaning they now stack with other drink effects.
[*]Adjusted the potion buffs and durations.
[/list]

[size=5]New Crops[/size]
[size=4]Flowering Cave Carrot[/size]
Carrots are a biennial plant (meaning it takes multiple years of growing before the plant will flower and produce seeds).
As such, I have implemented Cave Carrots as a 2 part plant.  Plant Cave Carrot Tops (the green part) to produce Cave Carrot Seed plants.
Cave Carrot Tops can be created from Cave Carrots in the crafting menu.
[size=3]Grow Time[/size]
Flowering Cave Carrot plants take 28 days to grow
[size=3]Growing Season[/size]
Flowering Cave Carrots can grow year round in any season.
[size=3]Produce[/size]
Flowering Cave Carrot plants produce multiple (5 to 16) cave carrot seeds every 5 days once fully grown.

[size=4]Cave Carrot[/size]
Cave Carrot Seeds can be planted to produce a cave carrot.
[size=3]Grow Time[/size]
Cave Carrots grow in 6 days.
[size=3]Growing Season[/size]
Cave Carrot Seeds are acclimated to cold caves and weak light.  They grow best in Winter and Spring.
[size=3]Produce[/size]
Produces Cave Carrot.

[size=4]Midnight Gourd[/size]
M"A large, dark gourd grown deep underground, thriving primarily on earth magic and weak red light.
[size=3]Grow Time[/size]
Midnight Gourds grow in 20 days and then regrow a new Gourd every 5 days.
[size=3]Growing Season[/size]
Midnight Gourds prefer weaker sunlight and colder tempatures. They grow in Fall, Winter and Spring.
[size=3]Produce[/size]
Produces 1 Midnight Gourd.

[size=4]Void Berry[/size]
A small, sour, dark purple berry grown by the Dwarves. It grows best near lava pools, as the heat is converted into energy for its growth.
[size=3]Grow Time[/size]
A void berry bush grow in 15 days and then regrows a batch of berries every 4 days.
[size=3]Growing Season[/size]
Void Berries like heat and grow in Spring, Summer and Fall.
[size=3]Produce[/size]
Produces 2 to 4 void berries.

[size=5]New Machines[/size]

[size=4]Dwarven Gem Polisher[/size]
Improves the quality of gems to increase their value.
Useful both to increase profit from gems found in the mines as well as to create better quality gems for higher quality jewelry.

[size=4]Dwarven Jewelry Making Machine[/size]
Turns gems or minerals and gold into fine jewelry.
Turns gemstones and minerals into an artisan good that can be sold for drasticly increased profits.

[size=4]Dwarven Pulverizer[/size]
Breaks down ore clusters into useful ore, allows you to recycle stone into useful products and can pulverize ore and gems into a fine powder that can be used to brew spirits and make potions.
[size=3]Automate Notes[/size]
Automate works out of the box, however Ore Clusters -> Ore -> Ore Dust requires some special considerion if you don't want all ore to become dust.  To improve compatability you have 2 options:
[list=1]
[*] Configuration Option to increase how many Ore are required to turn into Dust.  Combined with Chests Anywhere this allows you to ensure that Ore Clusters won't automatically turn into dust by setting the input Ore requirement to 7 or above and configuring an input and output chest.  If you enable this option the machine ready time and output number will scale with however many input ore are required (2 ore = double time, 10 ore = 10 times as long, etc).
[*] Configuration Option to disable Ore Dust recipes completely.  This works without Chests Anywhere, but means you won't be able to make Dwarven Spirits in the Still.
[/list]

[size=4]Dwarven Infuser[/size]
Infuse Dwarven Spirits with earth magic from ore dust and gem dust.
These infused spirits can be drank or sold as an artisan good.  Base Dwarven Spirits are now made in the Keg using Cave Carrot Mash.

[size=4]Alchemy Bench[/size]
Turns various ingredients into potion reagents which are used when creating potions in the cooking menu.  The reagents are:

[size=3]Notice[/size]
There is a bug in 1.6.9 where colored objects being produced in machines (like these reagents) will have the output stack size set to 1 regardless of the machine configuration.

This machine will suffer from this bug unless you have a fix for the bug, such as this one: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/31499]https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/31499[/url].

This fix is not mandatory, but you will get far less then my configured outputs without it.
