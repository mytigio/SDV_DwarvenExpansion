# SDV_DwarvenExpansion
A recreation of my Dwarvish mod for Stardew Valley using the expanded modding features available in 1.6


## New Crops
### Flowering Cave Carrot
Carrots are a biennial plant (meaning it takes multiple years of growing before the plant will flower and produce seeds).
As such, I have implemented Cave Carrots as a 2 part plant.  Plant Cave Carrot Tops (the green part) to produce Cave Carrot Seed plants.
Cave Carrot Tops can be created from Cave Carrots in the crafting menu.
#### Grow Time
Flowering Cave Carrot plants take 28 days to grow
#### Growing Season
Flowering Cave Carrots can grow year round in any season.
#### Produce
Produces multiple (5 to 16) cave carrot seeds every 5 days once fully grown.

### Cave Carrot
Cave Carrot Seeds can be planted to produce a cave carrot.
#### Grow Time
Cave Carrots grow in 6 days.
#### Growing Season
Cave Carrot Seeds are acclimated to cold caves and weak light.  They grow best in Winter and Spring.
#### Produce
Produces 1 Cave Carrot.

### Midnight Gourd
M"A large, dark gourd grown deep underground, thriving primarily on earth magic and weak red light.
#### Grow Time
Midnight Gourds grow in 20 days and then regrow a new Gourd every 5 days.
#### Growing Season
Midnight Gourds prefer weaker sunlight and colder tempatures. They grow in Fall, Winter and Spring.
#### Produce
Produces 1 Midnight Gourd.

### Void Berry
A small, sour, dark purple berry grown by the Dwarves. It grows best near lava pools, as the heat is converted into energy for its growth.
#### Grow Time
A void berry bush grow in 15 days and then regrows a batch of berries every 4 days.
#### Growing Season
Void Berries like heat and grow in Spring, Summer and Fall.
#### Produce
Produces 2 to 4 void berries.


## New Machines

### Dwarven Gem Polisher
Improves the quality of gems to increase their value.
Useful both to increase profit from gems found in the mines as well as to create better quality gems for higher quality jewelry.

### Dwarven Jewelry Making Machine
Turns gems or minerals and gold into fine jewelry.
Turns gemstones and minerals into an artisan good that can be sold for drasticly increased profits.

### Dwarven Pulverizer
Breaks down ore clusters into useful ore, allows you to recycle stone into useful products and can pulverize ore and gems into a fine powder that can be used to brew spirits and make potions.

### Dwarven Infuser
Infuse Dwarven Spirits with earth magic from ore dust and gem dust.
These infused spirits can be drank or sold as an artisan good.  Base Dwarven Spirits are now made in the Keg using Cave Carrot Mash.

### Slow-Burn Charcoal Kiln
A more efficient charcoal kiln that uses a longer lower heat burn to reduce waste and produce more coal per wood at the expense of time.  Harder woods burn more efficiently and produce more coal.

### Improved Mushroom Box
A crystalarium-like mushroom box.  Grows a steady supply of whatever mushroom is placed into it.  Better mushrooms take longer to grow.  Does not produce if placed outdoors.

### Clay mixer
A machine that mixes and presses soil, silica and water to produce a clay like substance every couple of days.

## New Animals

### Farm Grub
A large grub.  These grubs can be grown and harvested for their meat.  Useful for creating dwarven meals or fishing bait.

### Copper Crab
A mature rock crab.  These crabs filter copper out of their food and the copper grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure copper clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of copper ore.

As of 1.1.10 you can buy and sell crab eggs from Marlon's shop.

### Iron Crab
A mature rock crab.  These crabs filter iron out of their food and the iron grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure iron clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of iron ore.

As of 1.1.10 you can buy and sell crab eggs from Marlon's shop.

### Gold Crab
A mature lava crab.  These crabs filter gold out of their food and the gold grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure gold clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of gold ore.

As of 1.1.10 you can buy and sell crab eggs from Marlon's shop.

### Iridium Crab
A mature lava crab.  These crabs filter iridium out of their food and the iridium grows into thick deposits on their shell which can be scrapped off.  As the crabs age, these deposits can grow into large pure iridium clusters, which are broken down in a pulverizer into a large quantity of iridium ore.

As of 1.1.10 you can buy and sell crab eggs from Marlon's shop.

### Giant Naked Molerat
A giant naked molerat.  These molerats are one of the few subterranian mammals dwarves were able to domesticate.  They are used to harvest a thin milk, used frequently in dwarven cooking.

### Giant Pale Salamander
A giant cave salamander.  These salamanders are often kept as pets by dwarves.  They dig up coal, stones, small gems and other items while they burrow in search of bugs and crabs to eat.

### Badger
A subterranian mammal frequently found around dwarvish colonies.  They often dig up clay, tubers and roots While searching for small rodents and rabbits to eat.

## New Buildings

### Cave/Medium Cave/Large Cave
A farm animal building to house Grubs and Crabs. Level 2 and 3 come with an incubator to pupate grub larva and hatch crab eggs.  Level 3 comes with a feeding chute system that will keep the feeding troughs around the building full.

### Cavern
A large, dark underground cavern that can house Barn animals.  Has a large metal gate at the entrance to keep in more ferocious subterranian animals.
The Cavern is only available as a Deluxe building, complete with incubator, feed hopper and a feeding chute system to keep animals fed.

### Root Cellar / Large Root Cellar
A large underground room.  Often used for storing root vegetables.
Can be used as a space to process or store goods, similar to a shed. Floors and walls cannot be replaced.

### Dwarven Furnace
A large furnace, heated with the activated magic of solar essances.  This furnace never needs additional fuel beyond the solar essances it is constructed with, and it can smelt multiple materials at the same time.
Functions like a Mill, with products being processed and retrieved for the following morning.

Each day it can simultaniously process:
Up to 100 Copper Bars
Up to 30 Iron Bars
Up to 10 Gold Bars
Up to 6 Iridium Bars
Up to 6 Radioactive Bars
Up to 32 Refined Quartz from regular Quartz
Up to 96 Refined Quartz from Fire Quartz

However this machine takes up a 5x5 area, so the primary gain is in the farmer's time to load and unload materials.

## New Items

### Tools

#### Dwarven Pickaxe
A dwarven pickaxe, made of a magically blended iridium ore it is as powerful as iridium, but much lighter weight.  
It can be be swung faster and does not tire the user.  

As this pickaxe naturally has the efficient property, it does not benefit from the efficiency enchantment.

Rewarded from a new heart event with the dwarf.
